Easily add CrunchBase widgets to your posts and pages!

== Description ==

Easily include CrunchBase widgets, example syntax:

* &#91;cb type="company"&#93;Amazon&#91;/cb&#93;
* &#91;cb type="person"&#93;Jeremy Schoemaker&#91;/cb&#93;
* &#91;cb type="financial"&#93;Alliance Capital&#91;/cb&#93; 
* &#91;cb type="product"&#93;Amazon Kindle&#91;/cb&#93;

If you leave out the type=, it will default to company, so &#91;cb&#93;TechCrunch&#91;/cb&#93; would work too.
